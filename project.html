            <p class = "about-veryon">The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph).[8] The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013.[9][10]</p>
            <p class = "about-veryon">Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the marque's official website.[12][13] The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition models continued to be produced until 2015.</p>

            <p class = "about-mistral">The Bugatti Mistral, also called the Bugatti W16 Mistral, is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. It was revealed on 19 August 2022.[1]. The Mistral is marketed as the fastest roadster in the world.[2] Deliveries to customers will begin in early 2024.[3]. All 99 units were pre-sold at a price of 5 million euros.[4]</p>
            <p class = "about-mistral">The Mistral is not a cabaret model for the Bugatti Chiron, but a unique roadster model for Bugatti that marks the last vehicle to use the W16 engine that was introduced with the Bugatti Veyron in 2005.[5]</p>
